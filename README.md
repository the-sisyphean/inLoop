🚀 inLoop

A unified campus platform to stay in the loop with student societies, events, and activities — all in one place.

📌 Problem Statement

Campus clubs and student societies often rely on scattered communication channels like WhatsApp groups, posters, and spreadsheets. This leads to missed events, information overload, and poor coordination.

inLoop solves this by providing a single, structured platform where students can explore campus activities and clubs can manage events efficiently.
